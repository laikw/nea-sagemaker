# Deep Learning with Amazon SageMaker on Satellite Imagery

In this workshop, we will demonstrate how to train and host a semantic segmentation model with different deep learning models (DeepLab, UNet, and more) on a SpaceNet dataset to train a building segmentation model.

We will use the SpaceNet SN6: Multi-Sensor All-Weather Mapping dataset. The data is hosted on AWS as a [public dataset on Amazon S3](https://registry.opendata.aws/spacenet/).
